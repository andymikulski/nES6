# README for overtest
#

This code will test the behavior of the 6502's overflow flag for ADC and
SBC in binary mode. The two result bytes will be non-zero if any test
for the corresponding instruction fails. The actual value indicates
which tests failed (they're bitvectors).

If you want to actually compile this, you'll need at least the assmebler
and linker from cc65. You might even need version 2.4.1 in particular.

so much better knowing that?
